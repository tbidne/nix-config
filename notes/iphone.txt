See iphone.nix for necessary software. Here are some other notes.

After mounting with ifuse (ifuse ~/iphone), we can browse the files in the
CLI or automatically see them in KDE dolphin (the latter doesn't appear to
need ifuse).

Photos are generally in the DCIM folder. This is fine if we want to copy
everything over, but it is problematic if we want to copy e.g. a specific
folder.

Here is how I copied a shared album:

1. On my phone, go to the album in Photos, select all, then Share ->
   Export Unmodified Originals. I then saved these to a specific folder
   "My Export" (specifically _not_ one synced to iCloud).

2. Downloaded KDE Connect iPhone app. On my phone, copy/paste the new folder
   into KDE Connect. Confusingly, the KDE Connect folder might be hidden
   on the UI. But it exists, and we can search for it with the search bar
  in the Files app, and paste the folder into it.

3. In Dolphin, this folder shows up as iTommy/Apps/KDE Connect/Documents/My Export.
   This is in fact why we need KDE Connect, as apparently the Files directory
   structure does not appear to be in the iTommy directory.

4. Copy the files as needed (e.g. locally to laptop, upload to server).

If mounted with ifuse (probably unnecessary with dolphin), unmount iphone with
fusermount -u ~/iphone.
