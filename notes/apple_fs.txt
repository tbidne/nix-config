Supposedly need hfsprogs, which _is_ in nixpkgs, i.e., we can do:

    nix-shell -p hfsprogs

But it's either installed or mount has it built-in. In any case,
this works:

    sudo mount -t hfsplus -o force,rw /dev/sda2 ~/Mnt

Note we refer to the _partition_, not the entire drive.
I.e., `sudo fdisk /dev/sda` shows:

Device      Start        End    Sectors   Size Type
/dev/sda1      34     409633     409600   200M EFI System
/dev/sda2  409634 1953193983 1952784350 931.2G Apple HFS/HFS+
